    <title>What is Apache Maven?</title>
    <para>
        Apache Maven is a Java based build tool geared around reusable plugins,
        and dependencies. It provides a standardized approach to developing
        software which follow common patterns.

    <para>
        Maven projects build what are called artifacts, and are organized by
        three components: groupId, artifactId, and version. The groupId is
        generally shared amongst multiple artifacts and refers to either a
        company, or a project - a groupId usually follows Javaâ€™s package
        naming conventions of a reserved domain name -
        eg. com.smxemail.testapp.
